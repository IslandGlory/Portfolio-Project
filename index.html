  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>Hi! I'm Ada, Countess of Lovelace and am an English mathematician and writer, chiefly known for my work on Charles Babbage's     proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine.
    I am one of the first to recognize that machines have applications beyond pure calculation, and to have published the first     algorithm intended to be carried out by such a machine.
    In my free time I like to read about scientific developments, mathematics, and computational mathematics. I also like to take    my chances of winning big.</p>
